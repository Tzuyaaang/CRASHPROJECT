# Code-Based Email Verification Setup Guide

This guide explains the new code-based email verification system that replaces the link-based approach for better mobile app experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Changed

Instead of clicking email links that redirect to localhost, users now:
1. **Register** with their information
2. **Receive a 6-digit code** via email
3. **Enter the code** directly in the app
4. **Get verified** and logged in automatically

## âœ… Benefits

- âœ… **No more localhost redirects** - Works perfectly with Expo Go
- âœ… **Better mobile experience** - Users stay in the app
- âœ… **More secure** - Codes expire automatically
- âœ… **User-friendly** - Simple 6-digit code input
- âœ… **Resend functionality** - Users can request new codes

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### Registration Flow:
1. **User fills registration form** â†’ Clicks "Create Account"
2. **Supabase sends verification email** â†’ Contains 6-digit code
3. **App shows verification screen** â†’ User enters code
4. **Code is verified** â†’ User profile is created
5. **User is logged in** â†’ Redirected to Home screen

### Code Verification Screen Features:
- **6-digit code input** with number pad
- **Resend code button** with 60-second cooldown
- **Error handling** with clear messages
- **Back to registration** option
- **Loading states** for better UX

## ðŸ“‹ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Supabase Dashboard

Go to your Supabase dashboard â†’ **Authentication** â†’ **Settings**

**Enable Email Confirmations:**
- âœ… Check "Enable email confirmations"
- This ensures users must verify their email before accessing the app

**Email Template (Optional):**
- Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Email Templates**
- Select "Confirm signup" template
- Customize the message to mention the 6-digit code

### Step 2: Test the Flow

1. **Start your app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Register a new user:**
   - Fill out the registration form
   - Click "Create Account"
   - You should see the email verification screen

3. **Check your email:**
   - Look for the verification email from Supabase
   - Note the 6-digit code in the email

4. **Enter the code:**
   - Type the 6-digit code in the app
   - Click "Verify Email"
   - You should be logged in and redirected to Home

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Components

### EmailVerification Component Features:
- **Clean, centered design** with proper spacing
- **Large code input** with number pad keyboard
- **Resend functionality** with countdown timer

### Problem: Code verification fails
**Solutions:**
- Check network connection
- Verify Supabase configuration
- Check browser console for errors
- Try restarting the app

### Problem: User not logged in after verification
